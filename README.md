# Lanes

The application allows users to create vertical "lanes," which are individual sections in the interface that host iframes pointing to various URLs.
Users can add, refresh, modify, and remove these lanes as needed.
This makes it an ideal tool for anyone who needs to monitor or interact with multiple web-based resources at once, such as developers, researchers, or social media managers.
All lanes URLs are saved to local storage

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get the Project Lanes web application running on your local development environment:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the project (if necessary):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command should start the server and make the application available on `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if specified).

4. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view and interact with the application.

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system before running these commands.
